        #facing errors with these commands, ensured the libraries are imported.

        Rows: 20640     Training examples
        Columns: 10     Independent Variables

        IDEA: There are multiple independent variable, so we need to fit Multiple linear regression.
              Writing the Multiple regression equations in matrix form makes sense.

        Displaying correlation graph. Error: could not convert string to float resolved by removing those values in another df.

--->    Don't know what is Label encoding and Box-Cox Transformation

        Able to implement train_test_split, still don't know much about why the parameter are what they are, I just followed
        the commands from notebook!

        Following the kaggle notebook, looked up np.c_ and np.ones_  and their use. But the data manipulation will take getting used to.

        #So in MODEL BUILDING  we use our Matrix Equation.

        #This one is a little confusing. Right now just copying the code, will do it on paper.

        #Now you have everything for you Linear Regression Model!

        #So for 8 independent variables we have 8 parameters! Nice job!
